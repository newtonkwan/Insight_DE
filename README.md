## Result

## How does it work? 
A user will submit their data in one of a few different formats. We will then ingest the data and produce a report showing you three things about your data: 
1) Categories of your data
2) Basic information about your data  
3) Further user specified information

## Architecture

## Engineering challenges 
- Ingesting from one or more data sources 
- Creating a system that is fault tolerant as data scales 

## MVP
Ingest multiple data sources and generate a one page executive summary

## Stretch goals 
- Allow for larger data sources
- Allow user to choose which parts they want to include in the executive summary
