This file should live on the Spark Cluster Master Node 
The goal of this notebook is to move data from S3, store a small part of it in a Redis database that lives 
in another instance, then to display that small amount of data using Flask that lives in another instance.

# Read the data from an AWS S3 bucket
filenames = "s3a://open-research-corpus/corpus-2019-01-31/s2-corpus-00.gz" # path to the S3 file
data = sc.textFile(filenames) # reads and stores the data file 

data.first()
